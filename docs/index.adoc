== Boat Electronics Project

This document describes a DIY project of building a boat computer and a cockpit display
from easily obtainable and affordable components. The computer includes:

* GNSS (GPS, etc) receiver
* Sensors for orientation (gyroscope, compass via IMU)
* AIS radar
* Environment temperature, barometric pressure, humidity sensors
* Connections to the boat instruments such as wind, depth, speed via NMEA 0183 serial ports
* Optional autopilot integration
* Other NMEA devices
* Optional WiFi hotspot and router with WiFi extender and long range waterproof WiFi antenna
* Optional air mouse with a wireless keyboard and a touchpad
* Lightning EMI sensor and alarm
* RTL-SDR for weather fax, AIS, etc

The computer is connected to the waterproof HDMI touchscreen in
the cockpit. NMEA 2000 was not in scope of this project.

=== Boat Computer

The computer runs on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian Linux) with OpenPlotter 2.0 installed. The computer will reside below deck so
it's not going to be waterproof. The touchscreen displays OpenPlotter UI with OpenCPN chart plotter and dashboards as well as
general Linux UI.

*The front panel interfaces:*

* 1 USB 3.0 data port
* 1 USB 2.0 data port
* 1 HDMI port
* 1 AUX audio port
* Status indicators via fiber-optic light pipes
* Fuse box (panel mount?)
* On/Off power switch for the computer
* On/Off power switch for cockpit instruments

*The back panel interfaces:*

* 1 Ethernet port 1Gbit (for the WiFi router)
* 1 USB 2.0 port for GPS (or something else)
* 2 NMEA-0183 ports
* 2 DC power 2-wire cords mounted inside waterproof glands for 12v boat and cockpit connections
* HDMI and USB 3.0 connectors to the cockpit display and touchscreen
* RF connector for AIS antenna
* RF connector for RTL-SDR antenna
* RF connector for a secondary GPS

*Inside View*

On the picture 7-Port powered USB 3.0 hub, dAISy AIS, Raspberry Pi 4 with a cooling fan and heat sinks,
serial-to-USB stick (with the chipset from FTDI), SSD, RTL-SDR RF stick. 12v to 5v step-down converter is
located below this layer inside the housing box and is connected to the front panel via a fuse and
a switch on the front panel.

You can customize the front and back panels for your needs.

==== Simple Schematics

image::boat-computer.svg[alt=Boat Computer Diagram]

Raspberry Pi 4 has also WiFi and BlueTooth interfaces:

* 802.11ac/n
* Bluetooth 5.0

WiFi can be used to set up access to the boat computer from smart phones and tablets
with additional software.
