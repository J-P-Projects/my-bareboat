== Boat Electronics Project

This document describes a DIY project of building a marine computer, a boat LTE/WiFi gateway, and
a cockpit chartplotter display from easily obtainable and affordable components.
This boating electronics project includes:

* Waterproof marine touch screen HDMI display
* GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, Galileo) receiver
* Sensors for orientation (gyroscope, compass via IMU)
* AIS radar
* Environment temperature, barometric pressure, humidity sensors
* Connections to the boat instruments such as wind, depth, speed via NMEA 0183 serial ports
* Boat LTE / 4G Gateway
* Boat WiFi hotspot and a router with WiFi extender and a long range waterproof WiFi antenna
* Optional autopilot integration, rudder angle sensor
* Other NMEA devices, engine/battery status, bilge pump monitoring, etc
* Optional air mouse with a wireless keyboard and a touchpad
* Lightning EMI sensor and alarm
* RTL-SDR for weather fax, satellite weather, AIS, RTL 433, morse code decoder, etc
* Boat IoT Integration via MQTT
* Can be used with Iridium Satellite Modems
* Can be used for processing transmissions received from SSB radio via audio interface
* Variety of options of using wireless handheld devices such as smart phones and tablets
to connect to boat systems via WiFi and bluetooth. There are many marine applications available for
smart phones and tablets.

The boat computer is connected to the waterproof HDMI touchscreen in the cockpit.

NOTE: Keep in mind that following this document you are building devices to be used in marine environment.
All connections and wiring need to follow marine standards which are more strict than automotive. All nuts and bolts
needs to be properly tightened. I've run into issues in my sailboat experience on water just because of
one missing washer  (It was in mechanical system on gear switch wire). Heat shrink tubing, wire grades are different
for marine standards. Corrosion in misty salt water air is much higher than on the ground. A boat is exposed
to elements more than house or automobile appliances. If you doubt you did something right you better of
revisiting it or seeking peer review from  other sailors. Same works the other way. If you see something wrong
here with the design let us know :) There is issues reporting system in GitHub:
https://github.com/bareboat-necessities/my-bareboat/issues

NOTE: Although this document describes mostly instructions on building hardware components, it is designed in
the spirit of open source development. We hope this design is going to evolve and have numerous releases and corrections
if it gains some community. Some software components might become part of this too. Cost cutting is another sport and
sub-hobby in recreational sailing and boating. So if same functionality can be built cheaper it probably should be, and
here is the reason to change this document.

=== Boat Computer

The boat computer runs on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian Linux) with OpenPlotter 2.0 installed. The boat computer will reside
below deck so it's not going to be waterproof. The touchscreen display runs OpenPlotter UI with OpenCPN chartplotter
and dashboards as well as general Linux UI.

*The boat computer front panel interfaces:*

* 1 USB 3.0 data port
* 1 AUX audio port
* 1 USB 2.0 data port
* 1 HDMI port
* Computer Voltage Meter
* Combined device Amp and Voltage meter
* Status indicators via fiber-optic light pipes
* Fuse box panel mount
* On/Off power switch
* On/Off power switch for cockpit instruments

{zwsp} +

.Boat Computer Front Panel
image::front-panel-intf.jpg[alt="Boat Computer Front Panel", width="75%", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

*The boat computer back panel interfaces:*

* 1 Ethernet port 1Gbit (for the WiFi router)
* 1 USB 2.0 port for GPS (or something else)
* 1 NMEA-0183 port (More can be added in same DYI fashion)
* DC power 2-wire input cord mounted inside a waterproof gland for 12v boat connection. SAE-type connector
* DC power 2-wire output cord mounted inside a waterproof gland for 12v cockpit connection. SAE-type connector
(black male)
* HDMI and USB 3.0 connectors to the cockpit display and touchscreen
* RF connector for AIS antenna
* RF connector for RTL-SDR antenna
* SMA RF connector for a secondary GPS

*Boat Computer Inside View*

NOTE: Raspberry Pi lays on top of middle divider made out of plastic sheet. The power supply (12v to 5v step-down
converter) is mounted from the other side under the middle divider. The USB hub doesn't fit by height to simply lay
on the divider, so there is a little shelf made out of same plastic sheet and it is attached by 4 shortest
standoffs. USB hub is mounted a bit under angle to give space for a screw which closes the enclosure.


.Boat Computer Inside View
image::computer-internals.jpg[alt="Boat Computer Inside View", width="75%", align="center"]

{zwsp} +

On the picture 7-Port powered USB 3.0 hub, dAISy AIS, Raspberry Pi 4 with a cooling fan and heat sinks,
serial-to-USB stick (with the chipset from FTDI), SSD, RTL-SDR RF stick. 12v to 5v step-down converter is
located below this layer inside the housing box and is connected to the front panel via a fuse and
a switch on the front panel.

You can customize the front and back panels for your needs.

==== Basic Schematics

.Boat Computer Basic Schematics Diagram
image::boat-computer.svg[alt="Boat Computer Basic Schematics Diagram"]

{zwsp} +

Raspberry Pi 4 has also WiFi and BlueTooth interfaces:

* 802.11ac/n
* Bluetooth 5.0

WiFi can be used to set up access to the boat computer from smart phones and tablets
with additional software.

=== Boat Gateway Box

The second box is a boat LTE/WiFi/IoT gateway device and it is an extension to the boat computer.
In case if you do not need HDMI display you might need only the boat gateway because the boat gateway runs its own KPlex
server under OpenWrt Linux. The boat gateway has M5Stack ESP32 micro-controller and is capable to connect to NMEA
(if you customize if a bit further). The boat gateway is connected to the boat computer via Ethernet.
The boat gateway uses the same type of an enclosure as the boat computer.

Features of the boat gateway box:

* WiFi Gateway (connecting to marina's WiFi and on-shore WiFi hot-spots via a long range WiFi antenna)

* LTE / 4G Gateway (providing a boat with Internet and voice access within the zone of reception
of a cellular network)

* VPN gateway

* Ethernet Hub

* Network Access Storage, Network back-up

* M5Stack ESP32 Controller and 3-Buttons LCD display (panel mounted, numerous optional M2Stack add-ons)

* KPlex server running on router's OpenWrt Linux

* GPS NMEA 0183 talker via KPlex

* IoT gateway with MQTT

* Voltage and Amperage Display to monitor power consumption

* Any other additional sensors and devices can be added via M5Stack. M5Stack is programmable micro-controller without
an operating system but very capable of running complex programs

==== Boat Gateway Front Panel

* Power On/Off Switch

* Router Power On/Off Switch

* Panel Mounted Fuse Box

* Panel Mounted M5Stack LCD Display with 3 Buttons

* USB 2.0 Port RJ45 connected to M5Stack

"M5Stack" stands for "Modular 5cm Stackable".

Looks like waterproof version is already in works.

===== GL-AR750 Router Modifications

The AR-750 router needs to be modified to add external 2.4GHz antenna. Test U.FL connectors need to be removed
and real ones should be soldered. The existing U.FL connector is used by internal 5G band antenna.
See here:

https://www.arednmesh.org/comment/12706#comment-12706

===== GL-X750 (Spitz) Router Modifications

You get this router with the modem you selected for your region. My modem is Quectel EP06-A.
EP06-A has 3 antenna connectors. One is connected to external LTE antenna connector, another one
is Rx Diversity antenna to external connector and middle one is GPS antenna not connected. You can open up router
by unscrewing two screws under serial number sticker (it's easy to remove and put back after).
I've just put another coax cable to GPS antenna connector and cut a bit of plastic in the case just
enough to put that cable through (SMA side on outside).

The modem is controlled via 'AT' commands.

Make sure you connect antennas first before activating SIM card in the network or you might get error like:

 SIM card not registered

APN for AT&T has to be set to "broadband".
Device: /dev/ttyUSB2
Service: LTE/UMTS/GPRS


To enable the GPS you have to use

 AT+QGPS=1

command on /dev/ttyUSB2 and then one can read the nmea sentences on /dev/ttyUSB1.
There are additional commands to configure the GNSS functions, but they’re very limited compared
to “regular GNSS chips”. The details can be found in the Quectel EP06&EG06&EM06 GNSS AT Commands Manual.
(Registration required to download)

The command to reset the modem to factory defaults is

 AT+QPRTPARA=3

The router is running linux. While setting it up you can login into it like this:

 ssh root@192.168.8.1

The password would be the one you set in web UI.

Hmm:
There is even KPlex for OpenWrt. I think this GPS can be fed into OpenPlotter from the router!

https://github.com/caesar/kplex-openwrt

And you can install KPlex on a router (precompiled) from the router itself!

{zwsp} +

AT command for the GPS needs to be run every time on boot. This needs to be scripted.
Install the program called 'socat'. With it you can send commands to the modem from command line.

 echo "AT+QGPS=1" | socat - /dev/ttyUSB2,crnl

----

[serial]
name=gps
filename=/dev/ttyUSB1
direction=in
baud=9600
strict=no

[tcp]
name=router
mode=server
port=10110
direction=out

----


Add startup script

----

cat > /etc/init.d/modem-gps-init
#!/bin/sh  /etc/rc.common

START=98

start()
{
     echo "AT+QGPS=1" | socat - /dev/ttyUSB2,crnl
}

^D

chmod 755 /etc/init.d/modem-gps-init

----

Another modification: By default in GL-X750 one Ethernet port is set up as WAN and another is LAN.
You can reassign them both as LAN. It is done in web UI of the router.
One LAN port will go to main boat computer and another lan port you can connect to M5Stack LAN base module.
Or even have a ethernet hub inside if you plan bigger boat LAN (in that case you can leave one port as WAN and
connect the router via hub).

GL-X750 aka Spitz router power supply is 12v (No need for buying step-down converter).

NOTE: If you just need chart plotter capabilities it seems you do not even need raspberry pi. You could just install
KPlex on GL-X750 router make sure the modem you picked when you buy the router has GPS. And then you use
OpenCPN installed on an android tablet connected via WiFi to KPLex. And with this you have LTE internet on your boat
and local private WiFi.

=== Weather

There are multiple ways to receive weather predictions:

* Download GRIB files via internet. (Only works if internet is available).

* GRIB files via SSB radio (out of scope here)

* Weather FAX (some people just connect radio to computer audio input, record audio file and covert it
using utility into image). It would be nice to completely automate this process using RTL-SDR.
+
See: https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tag/weather-fax/

* Images from NOAA satellites via radio. RTL-SDR can be used to automate this as well.

== Pole for Sailboat Solar Panel / Wind Generator

This is no welding, no bends solution. The pole is built from universal stainless steel marine components.
To reproduce this design you would need only a pipe cutter tool and a drill.
The top is quick release adjustable angle (two axis). Removable for winter storage.
The solar panel is quickly detachable and removable.
